# Project 3 Word Ladder

The `five_letter_words.txt` file needs to be outside of the src folder while being tested. This is because the starter code for the assignment includes a `makeDictionary` method with this line in it: 

```
infile = new Scanner (new File("five_letter_words.txt"));
```


For example, you have a project named as assignment3. The `five_letter_words.txt` should be under assignment3. Not under src, not under other packages. It should just under assignment3.
